# clean-architecture

This documents Made Tech Flavoured Clean Architecture.

Clean Architecture is a variant of [Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) by Alistair Cockburn and,
[BCE](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach/dp/0201544350) by Ivar Jacobson.

The Made Tech flavour is a bit more relaxed in some areas than Hexagonal Architecture but more prescriptive than the basics of Clean Architecture and, at this time, we only have documentation about Ruby.
