# Clean Architecture

![Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/assets/posts/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture-8b00a9d7e2543fa9ca76b81b05066629.jpg)

This documents Made Tech Flavoured [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

Clean Architecture is a variant of [Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) by Alistair Cockburn and,
[BCE](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach/dp/0201544350) by Ivar Jacobson.

The Made Tech flavour is a bit more relaxed in some areas than Hexagonal Architecture but more prescriptive than the basics of Clean Architecture and, at this time, we only have documentation about Ruby.

# Long-term learning guide

We're beginning to put together [long-term learning goals](learn/README.md) for Clean Architecture, which individuals
can use to help provide some direction to areas which are required in order to be proficient at Clean Architecture.

# Architectural Concepts

* [Use Case](use_case.md)
* [Domain](domain.md)
* [Gateway](gateway.md)
* [Bounded Contexts](bounded_contexts.md)

# Examples in Languages

* [Ruby](ruby/README.md)
* [Kotlin](kotlin/README.md)
* Go 
* Clojure
* JS
